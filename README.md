# Deep-learning-on-stock-market
It is a pet project on understanding the use of LSTM deep learning model on 5 yr per minute basis tick data of Reliance(NSE) shares.
The loss function on the test data set has given me a loss of 0.008 which seems to be a good loss to start with.
I am trying to improve the model and understand its implcation on finding 10 minutes of forecast from the current price.
Any kind of ideas and suggestions wil be gladly welcomed.
Currently, I am using Kiteconnect by Zerodha brokerage for getting the historical data.
